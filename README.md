**Introduction to Java**
Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let application developers write once, run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.

Java Variables
1. Introduction to Variables in Java
Definition: A variable in Java is a storage location in memory with a specific type and an associated name that holds a value.
Purpose: Variables are used to store data that can be manipulated and accessed throughout a Java program.
2. Types of Variables
Java variables can be classified into several categories based on their scope, lifetime, and data types:

2.1. Based on Scope and Lifetime:
Instance Variables:

Also known as non-static fields.
Declared inside a class but outside any method, constructor, or block.
Each instance of the class has its own copy of the instance variables.
Initialized when an object of the class is created and destroyed when the object is destroyed.
Class Variables:

Also known as static fields.
Declared with the static keyword inside a class but outside any method, constructor, or block.
A single copy is shared among all instances of the class.
Initialized when the class is first loaded and destroyed when the class is unloaded.
Local Variables:

Declared inside a method, constructor, or block.
Scope is limited to the block in which they are declared.
Must be initialized before use.
Created when the block is entered and destroyed when the block is exited.
Parameters:

Variables that are passed to methods, constructors, or blocks.
Act as placeholders for the values that are passed to the method or constructor at runtime.
2.2. Based on Data Type:
Primitive Data Types:

byte: 8-bit signed integer.
short: 16-bit signed integer.
int: 32-bit signed integer.
long: 64-bit signed integer.
float: 32-bit floating point.
double: 64-bit floating point.
char: 16-bit Unicode character.
boolean: true or false.
Reference Data Types:

Objects and arrays.
Store references (memory addresses) to the actual data.
Include classes, interfaces, and arrays.
3. Variable Declaration and Initialization
Declaration: Specifying the variable type and name.

Syntax: type variableName;
Example: int count;
Initialization: Assigning an initial value to the variable.

Can be done at the time of declaration or later in the code.
Syntax: type variableName = value;
Example: int count = 10;
4. Variable Naming Conventions
Must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($).
Subsequent characters can be letters, digits, underscores, or dollar signs.
Should not be a Java reserved keyword.
Use camelCase for variable names.
Should be descriptive and convey the variableâ€™s purpose.
5. Default Values
Instance and class variables have default values if not explicitly initialized:
Numeric types (byte, short, int, long, float, double): 0 (or 0.0 for floating points).
char: '\u0000' (null character).
boolean: false.
Reference types: null.
Local variables do not have default values and must be explicitly initialized before use.
6. Constants
Declared using the final keyword.
Cannot be changed once initialized.
Naming convention typically uses uppercase letters with words separated by underscores.
Example: final int MAX_SPEED = 120;
7. Type Casting and Type Conversion
Implicit Casting (Widening Conversion): Automatic type conversion from a smaller to a larger type.
Example: int to long.
Explicit Casting (Narrowing Conversion): Manual type conversion from a larger to a smaller type using the cast operator.
Syntax: largerType smallerType = (smallerType) value;
Example: double to int.
8. Variable Scope
Class Level: Variables declared as instance or class variables are accessible to all methods within the class.
Method Level: Local variables are accessible only within the method they are declared.
Block Level: Variables declared inside blocks (e.g., loops, conditional statements) are accessible only within that block.
9. Best Practices
Initialize variables before use to avoid logical errors and improve code readability.
Use meaningful variable names to make the code self-documenting.
Keep the scope of variables as narrow as possible to enhance maintainability and reduce the risk of errors.
Avoid using magic numbers; use constants instead.

**Decision Structures in Java**
Decision structures are fundamental programming constructs that allow a program to choose different paths of execution based on conditions. In Java, these are mainly implemented using if, if-else, if-else-if, switch, and ternary operators. Understanding these constructs is crucial for writing efficient and readable code.

1. The if Statement
The if statement evaluates a boolean expression and executes the block of code only if the expression is true. It is the simplest form of decision-making.

Syntax:
if (condition) {
    // Code to execute if the condition is true
}
Usage:
Check for a single condition.
Execute code block only when a specific condition is met.
2. The if-else Statement
The if-else statement provides an alternative path of execution when the if condition is false.

Syntax:
if (condition) {
    // Code to execute if the condition is true
} else {
    // Code to execute if the condition is false
}
Usage:
Handle binary decisions.
Ensure that one of two blocks of code is always executed.
3. The if-else-if Ladder
The if-else-if ladder is used to test multiple conditions sequentially. It is an extension of the if-else statement.

Syntax:
if (condition1) {
    // Code to execute if condition1 is true
} else if (condition2) {
    // Code to execute if condition2 is true
} else if (condition3) {
    // Code to execute if condition3 is true
} else {
    // Code to execute if all conditions are false
}
Usage:
Handle multiple conditions.
Execute one block of code among many based on which condition is true first.
4. The switch Statement
The switch statement provides a more readable way to perform multiple conditional checks based on the value of a single variable.

Syntax:
switch (variable) {
    case value1:
        // Code to execute if variable == value1
        break;
    case value2:
        // Code to execute if variable == value2
        break;
    // more cases...
    default:
        // Code to execute if no case matches
}
Usage:
Replace complex if-else-if ladders when checking the same variable.
Improve code readability and maintainability.
5. The Ternary Operator
The ternary operator is a shorthand for if-else statements and is used to assign a value based on a condition.

Syntax:
variable = (condition) ? valueIfTrue : valueIfFalse;
Usage:
Simplify if-else statements that assign values.
Write more concise and readable code for simple conditions.
Common Practices
Readability: Ensure that decision structures are clear and readable. Avoid overly complex nested if statements.
Consistency: Follow consistent formatting and indentation to enhance readability.
Logic Separation: Keep business logic separate from decision structures for better maintainability.
Use switch for Known Values: Prefer switch over if-else for fixed, known values to improve readability.

**Repetition Structures in Java**

Repetition structures, also known as loops, are control flow statements that repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a specified condition remains true. In Java, there are three primary types of loops:

for Loop
while Loop
do-while Loop
Each type of loop serves different purposes and is used based on the specific requirements of the task.

1. for Loop
Purpose: The for loop is used when the number of iterations is known beforehand.

Structure:

Initialization: Sets up a loop control variable.
Condition: Evaluates before each iteration; if false, the loop terminates.
Iteration: Updates the loop control variable.
Syntax:
for (initialization; condition; iteration) {
    // Code to be executed
}
Use Cases:

Iterating over arrays or collections.
Repeating a block of code a specific number of times.
Characteristics:

Suitable for counting loops where you know in advance how many times you want to loop.
All three components (initialization, condition, iteration) are in a single line, making it compact and easy to read for known iteration ranges.
2. while Loop
Purpose: The while loop is used when the number of iterations is not known beforehand and depends on a condition.

Structure:

Condition: Evaluated before each iteration; if false, the loop terminates.
Syntax:
while (condition) {
    // Code to be executed
}
Use Cases:

Reading data until a sentinel value is encountered.
Executing a block of code as long as a certain condition is true.
Characteristics:

The condition is checked before the loop body is executed.
If the condition is initially false, the loop body will not be executed at all.
Useful for loops that may not execute even once.
3. do-while Loop
Purpose: The do-while loop is used when the block of code needs to be executed at least once before checking the condition.

Structure:

Condition: Evaluated after each iteration.
Syntax:

do {
    // Code to be executed
} while (condition);
Use Cases:

Menu-driven programs where the menu needs to be displayed at least once.
Input validation loops where the input must be processed at least once.
Characteristics:

The loop body is executed at least once regardless of the condition.
The condition is checked after the loop body, making it a post-test loop.
Loop Control Statements
Java provides specific statements to control the flow within loops:

break Statement:

Exits the loop immediately.
Often used with conditional statements to exit the loop prematurely.
continue Statement:

Skips the current iteration and proceeds to the next iteration of the loop.
Used to skip certain conditions within a loop without terminating the entire loop.
Syntax:
break;
continue;
Nested Loops
Purpose: When loops are placed inside another loop, they are known as nested loops.

Use Cases:

Working with multidimensional arrays.
Complex iteration schemes where each iteration of the outer loop triggers a full iteration of the inner loop.
Characteristics:

The inner loop runs completely for every single iteration of the outer loop.
Care must be taken with nested loops to avoid performance issues, especially with large datasets.
Common Loop Pitfalls
Infinite Loops: Occur when the loop's terminating condition is never met.
Can be caused by incorrect conditions or failing to update the loop control variable.
Off-by-One Errors: Common in loops with incorrect start or end conditions, leading to unexpected iterations.
Unintended Side Effects: Modifying variables outside the loop that are used in the loop condition or body.

**Methods in Java**
1. Introduction to Methods
Definition: Methods are blocks of code that perform a specific task and can be invoked to execute that task. They promote code reusability and modularity.
Purpose: To execute a sequence of statements, perform calculations, manipulate data, and interact with objects.
2. Method Structure
Declaration: A method must be declared within a class. The basic syntax includes a method signature and a body.
Syntax:
Access Modifier: Determines the visibility of the method (e.g., public, private, protected, default).
Return Type: Specifies the type of value the method returns. If no value is returned, the return type is void.
Method Name: Identifier to call the method.
Parameter List: Enclosed in parentheses, specifies input parameters, if any.
Method Body: Enclosed in braces {}, contains the code to be executed.
3. Types of Methods
Instance Methods: Belong to an instance of a class. They require an object to be called.
Static Methods: Belong to the class rather than any object. They can be called using the class name.
Abstract Methods: Declared without an implementation and must be implemented by subclasses.
Final Methods: Cannot be overridden by subclasses.
4. Method Overloading
Definition: Multiple methods can have the same name but different parameter lists (number, type, or both).
Purpose: Increases the readability of the program and allows the same method to perform different tasks based on input parameters.
5. Method Overriding
Definition: A subclass provides a specific implementation for a method already defined in its superclass.
Rules: The method in the subclass must have the same name, return type, and parameters. The access level cannot be more restrictive than the overridden method.
6. Method Parameters
Pass-by-Value: Java passes arguments by value. For primitive types, the actual value is passed. For objects, the reference to the object is passed.
Varargs: Allows passing a variable number of arguments of the same type to a method. Declared using ellipsis (...).
7. Return Statement
Purpose: Terminates the method and optionally returns a value to the caller.
Syntax: return value; where value must match the method's return type.
Void Methods: Use return; to exit the method without returning a value.
8. Access Control
Public Methods: Accessible from any other class.
Private Methods: Accessible only within the class they are declared.
Protected Methods: Accessible within the same package or subclasses.
Default (Package-Private) Methods: Accessible only within the same package.
9. Method Invocation
Instance Methods: Called using the object reference.
Static Methods: Called using the class name.
Recursive Methods: Methods that call themselves. Useful for tasks that can be divided into similar sub-tasks.
10. Best Practices
Method Naming: Use meaningful names that describe the task performed by the method.
Single Responsibility Principle: Each method should perform a single task or functionality.
Parameter Limitation: Avoid excessive parameters; consider using objects to encapsulate multiple parameters.
Documentation: Use comments and JavaDoc to describe the method's purpose, parameters, and return values.
11. Error Handling
Exception Handling: Methods should handle exceptions appropriately using try-catch blocks or by declaring throws clauses for checked exceptions.
Assertions: Can be used within methods to validate assumptions about the method's behavior and parameters.

**Objects in Java**
1. Introduction to Objects in Java
Definition: An object is an instance of a class. It contains state (attributes) and behavior (methods).
Classes and Objects: Classes define the blueprint for objects. An object is created from a class.
2. Creating Objects
Instantiation: Creating an object involves allocating memory for it and initializing its attributes.
Syntax: Using the new keyword followed by the class constructor.
3. Object Structure
State: Represented by fields (variables) that hold data.
Instance Variables: Unique to each object instance.
Class Variables: Shared among all instances of a class, declared with the static keyword.
Behavior: Defined by methods that operate on the object's state.
Instance Methods: Operate on instance variables.
Static Methods: Operate on class variables or perform general utility functions.
4. Object Lifecycle
Creation: Objects are created using constructors.
Usage: Objects are manipulated using methods and properties.
Destruction: Managed by the Java Garbage Collector, which reclaims memory occupied by objects that are no longer referenced.
5. Constructors
Purpose: Initialize new objects.
Types:
Default Constructor: Provided by Java if no constructors are explicitly defined.
Parameterized Constructor: Allows initializing objects with specific values.
Copy Constructor: (Not native in Java but can be implemented) Initializes an object using another object of the same class.
6. Accessing Members
Dot Notation: Access fields and methods using the dot operator (.).
Example: objectName.methodName(), objectName.fieldName.
Encapsulation: Access modifiers (private, protected, public, default) control the visibility and accessibility of class members.
7. Object References
Reference Variables: Store the address of the object.
Null Reference: A reference variable that does not point to any object.
8. Inheritance and Objects
Superclass and Subclass: Objects of a subclass inherit fields and methods from the superclass.
Method Overriding: Subclass can provide a specific implementation of a method already defined in its superclass.
Polymorphism: Allows objects to be treated as instances of their superclass rather than their actual class.
9. Object Equality
Reference Equality: Using == operator checks if two references point to the same object.
Logical Equality: Using equals() method to check if two objects are logically equivalent.
10. Common Object Methods
toString(): Returns a string representation of the object.
hashCode(): Returns a hash code value for the object, used in hashing based collections.
clone(): Creates a copy of the object (must implement Cloneable interface).
11. Object Serialization
Purpose: Converting an object into a byte stream to save it to a file or send it over a network.
Serializable Interface: A marker interface that must be implemented for an object to be serialized.
12. Design Principles
Encapsulation: Keeping the state of an object hidden and accessible only through methods.
Abstraction: Hiding complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features.
Modularity: Designing objects to be self-contained and reusable.
13. Best Practices
Use Access Modifiers: Protect the integrity of the object's state by using private fields and providing public getter and setter methods.
Override toString(), equals(), and hashCode(): Provide meaningful implementations to improve usability and performance in collections.
Avoid Heavy Object Creation: Reuse objects where possible to improve performance and reduce memory overhead.

**Module 2: Java 102 - Java Fundamentals**

**Inheritance**
1. Introduction to Inheritance
Definition: Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) where a new class (subclass or derived class) inherits properties and behaviors (fields and methods) from an existing class (superclass or base class).
Purpose: It promotes code reuse and establishes a natural hierarchy between classes, making the code more modular and easier to maintain.
2. Key Concepts of Inheritance
Superclass (Parent Class): The class whose properties and methods are inherited by another class.
Subclass (Child Class): The class that inherits properties and methods from another class.
extends Keyword: Used to define a subclass in Java. For example, class Child extends Parent { }.
3. Types of Inheritance in Java
Single Inheritance: A class inherits from one superclass. This is the most common type in Java.
Multilevel Inheritance: A class is derived from another subclass, forming a chain. For example, Class A -> Class B -> Class C.
Hierarchical Inheritance: Multiple classes inherit from one superclass. For example, Class B and Class C both extend Class A.
4. Java Inheritance Characteristics
Single Inheritance Only: Java does not support multiple inheritance directly (i.e., a class cannot inherit from more than one class). This limitation is circumvented using interfaces.
Constructor Calls: When a subclass object is created, the constructor of the superclass is invoked first. This ensures proper initialization of the object.
5. Method Overriding
Definition: When a subclass provides a specific implementation for a method already defined in its superclass.
Rules:
The method in the subclass must have the same name, return type, and parameters as the method in the superclass.
The method in the subclass should not have a more restrictive access modifier than the one in the superclass.
The @Override annotation is often used to indicate that a method is being overridden.
Purpose: To provide specific behavior in the subclass that differs from the superclass.
6. super Keyword
Usage:
To refer to the immediate superclass object.
To invoke the superclass's methods.
To call the superclass's constructor. This must be the first statement in the subclass constructor.
Example: super.methodName() or super(parameterList) for constructors.
7. Access Modifiers and Inheritance
Private Members: Not inherited. They are accessible only within the same class.
Protected Members: Inherited and accessible within the same package and by subclasses.
Default (Package-Private) Members: Inherited and accessible within the same package.
Public Members: Inherited and accessible from anywhere.
8. Polymorphism
Definition: The ability of an object to take on many forms. In the context of inheritance, it refers to the ability to call the overridden methods through a reference of the superclass type.
Dynamic Method Dispatch: Java determines the method to be executed at runtime rather than compile time. This allows for flexible and dynamic method calls.
Example: Parent p = new Child(); p.method(); - The method of the Child class will be called if it overrides the method in the Parent class.
9. Abstract Classes and Methods
Abstract Class: A class that cannot be instantiated and is declared with the abstract keyword. It may contain abstract methods which are methods without a body.
Abstract Method: A method that is declared without an implementation and must be implemented by subclasses.
Purpose: To provide a common base class with some methods to be shared and others to be implemented by subclasses.
10. Inheritance and Interfaces
Difference: Inheritance involves a class inheriting another class. Interfaces, on the other hand, involve a class implementing a contract defined by the interface.
Interface Inheritance: A class can implement multiple interfaces, thus achieving multiple inheritance of type.
11. Best Practices and Considerations
Avoiding Excessive Inheritance: Deep inheritance hierarchies can make code harder to understand and maintain. Prefer composition over inheritance where appropriate.
Proper Use of super: Use super carefully to avoid unexpected behavior.
Documenting Overridden Methods: Always use the @Override annotation for clarity and to avoid errors.

**Polymorphism**
Introduction to Polymorphism
Definition: Polymorphism is a concept in Java that allows methods to perform different tasks based on the object that is invoking them. It is derived from the Greek words "poly" (many) and "morph" (form).
Types of Polymorphism: Java supports two types of polymorphism:
Compile-time polymorphism (Static polymorphism)
Runtime polymorphism (Dynamic polymorphism)
Compile-time Polymorphism
Method Overloading: One way to achieve compile-time polymorphism in Java. It occurs when a class has multiple methods with the same name but different parameters (method signatures).
Parameters Differ: Methods can differ by the number of parameters or the type of parameters.
Advantages: Increases the readability of the program and allows for defining methods that perform similar tasks with different inputs.
Binding: Method calls are resolved at compile-time.
Runtime Polymorphism
Method Overriding: One way to achieve runtime polymorphism. It occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation for a method already defined in its superclass.
Inheritance: The method in the subclass should have the same name, return type, and parameters as the method in the parent class.
Annotations: The @Override annotation is used to indicate that a method is intended to override a method in a superclass.
Dynamic Method Dispatch: The decision about which method to call is made at runtime based on the object being referred to.
Advantages: Provides flexibility to a program and allows a single interface to be used for a general class of actions.
Key Concepts in Polymorphism
Upcasting: Assigning a reference variable of a subclass to a variable of a superclass. This is implicit and does not require a cast.
Example: If Dog is a subclass of Animal, Animal a = new Dog(); is upcasting.
Downcasting: Assigning a reference variable of a superclass to a variable of a subclass. This requires an explicit cast.
Example: Dog d = (Dog) a; where a is of type Animal.
Advantages of Polymorphism
Code Reusability: Allows the reuse of existing code, making programs more modular and maintainable.
Flexibility and Scalability: Enhances flexibility in code and allows for the easy extension of the program.
Readability and Maintainability: Makes the code more readable and easier to maintain by reducing the complexity of the code.
Polymorphism in Interfaces
Interface Implementation: When a class implements an interface, it must provide implementations for all the abstract methods declared in the interface.
Multiple Implementations: Different classes can implement the same interface in different ways, leading to different behaviors for the same method call.
Interface References: An interface reference can hold objects of any class that implements the interface.
Practical Examples
Animal Class Example:
Superclass: Animal
Subclasses: Dog, Cat
Methods: makeSound(), overridden in each subclass to provide specific sounds like barking for Dog and meowing for Cat.
Shape Class Example:
Superclass: Shape
Subclasses: Circle, Rectangle
Methods: draw(), overridden in each subclass to provide specific drawing implementations.

**Abstraction**
Definition:
Abstraction is one of the four fundamental Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. In Java, abstraction is the process of hiding the implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object. It allows the user to interact with the object without knowing the underlying complexity.

Purpose of Abstraction:

Reduce Complexity: Simplifies complex systems by breaking them into more manageable pieces.
Enhance Code Maintainability: By separating the implementation from the interface, changes to the implementation do not affect the users of the interface.
Improve Code Reusability: Interfaces and abstract classes can be used to define common behavior that can be reused across different implementations.
Increase Security: By exposing only necessary parts of an object and hiding the rest, it helps in safeguarding critical information and methods.
Abstraction Mechanisms in Java:

Abstract Classes:

An abstract class cannot be instantiated directly; it serves as a blueprint for other classes.
It can contain both abstract methods (without a body) and concrete methods (with a body).
Abstract methods must be implemented by any concrete subclass.
Example Use Case: When there are common behaviors among classes, but certain details are left to be implemented by the subclasses.
Interfaces:

Interfaces in Java are used to specify a set of methods that a class must implement.
An interface can only contain method signatures (abstract methods by default) and static final variables (constants).
A class can implement multiple interfaces, which helps to achieve multiple inheritance.
Example Use Case: When you want to define a contract for classes without dictating the class hierarchy.
Comparison between Abstract Class and Interface:

Abstract Class:

Can have both abstract and non-abstract methods.
Can have constructors and member variables.
A class can inherit only one abstract class due to Java's single inheritance model.
Used when classes share a common base and some methods are common to all classes but some are specific to subclasses.
Interface:

Can only have abstract methods (Java 8 and later allow default and static methods).
Cannot have constructors or member variables (only static final variables).
A class can implement multiple interfaces, providing a way to achieve multiple inheritance.
Used to specify behaviors that a class must implement, regardless of where the class is located in the inheritance hierarchy.
Levels of Abstraction:

High-Level Abstraction: Exposing only the most general and essential operations. For example, an interface representing a List.
Mid-Level Abstraction: Providing a more detailed but still simplified view of the system. For example, an abstract class representing an AbstractList.
Low-Level Abstraction: Detailed implementation specifics, typically hidden from the user. For example, concrete classes like ArrayList or LinkedList.
Benefits of Abstraction:

Encapsulation: Keeps the implementation details private and exposes only what is necessary.
Flexibility: Allows the implementation to be changed without affecting the users of the abstraction.
Simplified Interface: Users interact with the simplified, abstract interface rather than complex implementations.
Examples of Abstraction in Real Life:

Vehicles: An abstract class Vehicle could have abstract methods like startEngine() and stopEngine(). Concrete subclasses like Car and Bike would implement these methods.
Electronics: An interface RemoteControl might define methods turnOn() and turnOff(). Different devices like TV and AirConditioner would implement these methods.
Best Practices:

Keep Abstraction Levels Appropriate: Donâ€™t expose more than necessary, but also donâ€™t hide critical details that users need to know.
Use Abstract Classes and Interfaces Judiciously: Prefer interfaces for defining roles and capabilities, and abstract classes for shared base functionality with some shared implementation.
Consistency: Ensure that the abstracted methods and properties are logically grouped and consistently applied.

**Data Structures**
What are Data Structures?
Data structures are a way of organizing and storing data to enable efficient access and modification.
In Java, data structures are implemented using classes and interfaces provided by the Java Collections Framework (JCF).
Java Collections Framework (JCF)

JCF provides a set of interfaces (e.g., List, Set, Map) and classes (e.g., ArrayList, HashSet, HashMap) for working with collections of objects.
It offers both generic and non-generic versions of collections.
Types of Data Structures

List: Ordered collection of elements that allows duplicate entries (e.g., ArrayList, LinkedList).
Set: Collection of unique elements, no duplicates allowed (e.g., HashSet, TreeSet).
Queue: First-in, first-out (FIFO) data structure (e.g., LinkedList, PriorityQueue).
Map: Key-value pairs, each key is unique (e.g., HashMap, TreeMap).
List Data Structures
ArrayList

Implements List interface, allows dynamic resizing.
Supports random access using index.
Good for frequent access and retrieval.
LinkedList

Implements List and Queue interfaces.
Provides efficient insertion and deletion operations (especially in the middle).
Suitable for implementing stacks, queues, etc.
Set Data Structures
HashSet

Implements Set interface using a hash table.
Does not allow duplicate elements.
Provides constant-time performance for add, remove, and contains operations on average.
TreeSet

Implements Set interface using a balanced tree structure.
Elements are stored in sorted order (natural ordering or comparator-defined).
Offers log(n) time complexity for add, remove, and contains operations.
Queue Data Structures
LinkedList

Doubly linked list implementation of Queue interface.
Supports FIFO operations like enqueue and dequeue efficiently.
Can also function as a double-ended queue (Deque).
PriorityQueue

Implements Queue interface using a priority heap.
Elements are ordered based on their natural ordering or a comparator.
Offers efficient retrieval of the highest-priority element.
Map Data Structures
HashMap

Implements Map interface using hash table.
Key-value pairs are stored based on hash codes.
Provides constant-time performance for basic operations on average.
TreeMap

Implements Map interface using a Red-Black tree.
Keys are stored in sorted order (natural ordering or custom comparator).
Offers log(n) time complexity for basic operations.
Common Operations on Data Structures
Insertion: Adding elements to the data structure.
Deletion: Removing elements from the data structure.
Search: Finding elements based on specific criteria.
Traversal: Visiting all elements in the data structure.
Sorting: Arranging elements in a specified order.
Merging: Combining two data structures into one.
Splitting: Separating a data structure into smaller parts.

**Functional Programming**
Functional programming is a programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing state and mutable data. In Java, functional programming concepts were introduced in Java 8 with the inclusion of lambda expressions, functional interfaces, and the Stream API.

Lambda Expressions
Lambda expressions are anonymous functions that allow you to treat functionality as a method argument or to create small, one-time use methods. They are denoted by the arrow -> syntax. For example, (parameters) -> expression or (parameters) -> { statements; }.

Lambda expressions facilitate a more concise and readable code structure, especially when working with functional interfaces.

Functional Interfaces
Functional interfaces are interfaces that contain only one abstract method. Java provides several built-in functional interfaces such as Function, Predicate, Consumer, and Supplier. These interfaces are used extensively with lambda expressions to provide functionality in a functional programming style.

Functional interfaces enable developers to pass behavior as arguments, which is a key aspect of functional programming.

Streams API
The Streams API in Java provides a functional approach to processing collections of objects. It allows developers to perform operations such as filter, map, reduce, and collect on streams of data. Streams are lazy and can be parallelized, making them efficient for handling large datasets.

Streams promote immutability and avoid side effects, which aligns with the principles of functional programming.

Immutability
Functional programming encourages immutability, which means once an object is created, its state cannot be changed. In Java, you can create immutable classes using the final keyword for fields and providing only getter methods. Immutability leads to safer and more predictable code.

Pure Functions
Pure functions are functions that always return the same output for the same input and have no side effects. They rely only on their input parameters and do not modify external state. Pure functions are easy to test and reason about, making code more reliable and maintainable.

Higher-Order Functions
Higher-order functions are functions that take other functions as arguments or return functions as results. They allow for abstraction and composition of functionality, enabling developers to write more reusable and modular code.

Optional and Functional Error Handling
In functional programming, error handling is often done using constructs like Optional or functional approaches such as try-catch blocks inside lambda expressions. Optional provides a way to represent optional values and avoid null pointer exceptions.

Functional error handling promotes a more declarative and composable style of handling exceptional cases.

**Exception Handling**
Exception handling in Java is a mechanism to handle runtime errors and exceptional situations that may occur during the execution of a program. It helps in maintaining the normal flow of the program by gracefully handling unexpected situations.

Types of Exceptions
Checked Exceptions: These are exceptions that are checked at compile time. They are usually recoverable and must be caught or declared in the method signature using the throws keyword.

Unchecked Exceptions (Runtime Exceptions): These are exceptions that are not checked at compile time. They typically occur due to programming errors, such as dividing by zero or accessing an array out of bounds. They don't need to be caught explicitly but can be if required.

Errors: These are exceptional conditions that are beyond the control of the application, such as system errors or resource exhaustion. They should not be caught or handled by the application.

Exception Handling Keywords
try: The try block is used to enclose the code that might throw an exception. It is followed by one or more catch blocks or a finally block.

catch: A catch block is used to handle a specific type of exception that may be thrown within the corresponding try block. Multiple catch blocks can be used to handle different types of exceptions.

finally: The finally block is used to execute code that should always run, regardless of whether an exception is thrown or not. It is often used for cleanup tasks like closing resources.

Exception Handling Best Practices
Catch Specific Exceptions: Always catch specific exceptions rather than catching the general Exception class. This allows for more precise handling of different types of exceptions.

Handle Exceptions Appropriately: Decide whether an exception should be caught and handled locally or propagated up the call stack. Sometimes, it's better to let the caller handle the exception.

Use Finally for Cleanup: When working with resources like file I/O or database connections, use the finally block to ensure that resources are properly released, even if an exception occurs.

Avoid Empty Catch Blocks: Avoid catching exceptions without any handling code (catch(Exception e) {}). At the very least, log the exception or take appropriate action.

Use Custom Exceptions: For application-specific errors or exceptional conditions, consider creating custom exception classes that extend the Exception class. This improves code readability and maintainability.

Logging: Always log exceptions and error messages to aid in debugging and troubleshooting.

Exception Propagation
Exceptions can be propagated up the call stack if they are not caught and handled locally. This means that if a method doesn't catch an exception, it will be passed to the calling method, and so on until it's caught or until it reaches the top-level caller (e.g., the main method).

Common Exception Handling Patterns
Try-Catch: Used for handling exceptions within a specific block of code.

Try-Finally: Used for cleanup tasks that must be performed regardless of whether an exception occurs or not.

Try-Catch-Finally: Combines exception handling and cleanup tasks in one block of code.

Nested Try-Catch: Used when different parts of code may throw different types of exceptions, and you want to handle them separately.

Chained Exceptions: Used to associate one exception with another, providing more context about the error.

Streams and Lambda Expressions: 
Streams
Definition: A Stream in Java represents a sequence of elements supporting sequential and parallel aggregate operations. Streams are not data structures; they do not store elements. Instead, they convey data from a source through a pipeline of computational operations.

Stream Operations:

Intermediate Operations: Transform a stream into another stream. Examples include filter(), map(), and sorted(). These operations are lazy; they are not executed until a terminal operation is invoked.
Terminal Operations: Produce a result or a side-effect, and after this, the stream is considered consumed and no longer usable. Examples include collect(), forEach(), and reduce().
Pipeline: A sequence of stream operations chained together. It typically starts with a source, followed by intermediate operations, and ends with a terminal operation.

Sources for Streams: Collections (like List, Set), arrays, I/O channels, or any data source.

Advantages of Streams:

Conciseness: Allows for more readable and compact code.
Parallelism: Simplifies writing parallel code. Streams can be easily switched to parallel mode with parallelStream().
Pipelining: Intermediate operations are optimized via lazy evaluation, which can improve performance.
Examples of Common Stream Operations:

Filter: Excludes elements based on a condition.
Map: Transforms each element into another object.
Sorted: Orders the elements based on a comparator.
Collect: Accumulates the elements into a collection or another data structure.
Lambda Expressions
Definition: Lambda expressions are a feature in Java that provide a clear and concise way to represent one method interface using an expression. They are essentially a shorthand notation for implementing functional interfaces.

Syntax: (parameters) -> expression or (parameters) -> { statements; }

Example: (int x, int y) -> x + y
Functional Interfaces: An interface with only one abstract method. Examples include Runnable, Callable, Comparator, and custom interfaces annotated with @FunctionalInterface.

Key Features of Lambda Expressions:

Simplification: Reduces boilerplate code, making code more readable and concise.
Anonymous: Lambda expressions are anonymous, meaning they do not have a name and can be implemented on-the-fly.
Capturing Variables: Lambdas can capture (access) both final or effectively final variables from the enclosing scope.
Common Use Cases:

Collections: Sorting, filtering, and mapping using stream operations.
Concurrency: Simplifying the creation of threads and tasks.
Event Handling: Defining event handlers in GUI applications.
Differences from Anonymous Classes:

Syntax: Much more concise than anonymous inner classes.
Scoping: Lambdas do not have a this reference and cannot shadow variables from the enclosing scope.
Interplay between Streams and Lambda Expressions
Functional Programming: Streams and lambda expressions together facilitate a functional programming style in Java, emphasizing immutability and side-effect-free functions.
Readability and Maintainability: They improve code readability and maintainability by providing a declarative approach to complex data processing tasks.
Parallelism: Simplify writing concurrent code by abstracting thread management.

Generics and Collections in Java
Generics
Definition and Purpose

Generics allow for the definition of classes, interfaces, and methods with placeholder types.
They enable code reusability and type safety without the need for casting.
Generics can be used to define a single type or multiple types.
Benefits of Generics

Type Safety: Ensures that only a specific type of object is allowed, reducing runtime errors.
Elimination of Casts: Reduces the need for explicit casting, making the code cleaner.
Reusability: Enables the creation of generic algorithms that work with any object type.
Syntax

Generic Class: class ClassName<T> { /* ... */ }
Generic Method: <T> ReturnType methodName(Parameters) { /* ... */ }
Bounded Types: class ClassName<T extends Bound> { /* ... */ }
Example: <T extends Number>, allowing only types that are subclasses of Number.
Common Generic Types

T - Type
E - Element
K - Key
V - Value
N - Number
Wildcard Types

Unbounded Wildcard: <?> - any type
Bounded Wildcards:
<? extends T> - any type that is a subclass of T
<? super T> - any type that is a superclass of T
Type Erasure

The process by which the Java compiler removes all type information during compilation.
Ensures backward compatibility with older versions of Java that do not support generics.
Collections
Definition and Purpose

Collections are data structures that store groups of objects.
Java provides the java.util package, which contains various collection classes and interfaces.
Collection Interfaces

Collection: The root interface for all collection types.
